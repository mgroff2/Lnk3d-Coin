## Step1: vCard Setup

This portion of the setup can be done from a computer or mobile device. You will need access to a browser and ability to create/store a password for later use.

- Go to [https://vCard.link](https://vCard.link)
- Name your card "Company-FirstName" 
  - This is arbitrary, I have two. One for work, one for home. 
- Enter your Work or Personal or Work email address and create a password.
- Fill out your information that youâ€™d like to have people see.

Once done, you will have a link as such: [https://vcard.link/card/DG5m](https://vcard.link/card/DG5m)
